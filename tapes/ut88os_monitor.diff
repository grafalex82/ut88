The following describes differences between ut88os_monitor_orig.rku and ut88os_monitor.rku binary files.

- UT-88 display uses pretty odd cursor highlighting - symbol next to the cursor position is highlighted
  instead of symbol under cursor. This does not look like a bug, but rather than intentional behavior -
  there is dedicated code in the MonitorF and UT-88 OS Monitor that increments to the symbol next to the
  cursor position. At the same time nowadays it looks very unusual and inconvenient. This change sets
  cursor highlighting to the cursor position. Note, that this change shall be accompanied with the change
  in main.py, that calculates same shift as well.

- A magic constant 0x5f specify cursor blinking pattern. There is some sophisticated logic around this 
  constant that causes cursor blink for a short time, and then have a long pause. Since emulation speed is
  much less than real hardware, cursor blinking in this mode is too slow and unobvious. Constant 0x07 works
  much better under emulation, and provides uniform blinking at a ~2Hz speed.

- The UT-88 OS Monitor keyboard scanning function perfectly matches MonitorF behavior, and particularly 
  produce char codes in 0x01-0x1f range when a symbol is entered with Ctrl modifier. Instead other programs
  in the UT-88 OS suite (including this monitor) expect normal charcodes in 0x41-0x5f range. Programs and
  monitor additionally check Keyboard Port C for a Ctrl key bit. This particular chance remove 0x4x -> 0x0x
  conversion, so that other programs work as expected.

- This is an obvious bug in the scroll loop - the loop address is stated incorrectly, and points in the middle
  of an instruction in other function. Original code jumps to a wrong memory area, and eventually execute an
  illegal instruction. Fortunately the idea of this code is pretty straightforward, and the loop address can
  be easily corrected

- When scrolling is performed one line up, the last line on the screen must be cleared. For some reason 
  original code references line address in the area (0xe000+) which does not exist according to the official
  schematics. The address is corrected to the normal video RAM area (0xe800+)
